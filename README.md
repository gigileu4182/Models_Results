## 计量，统计，my modelling thought:

0. 
1. discrete/continuous
2. there is always a trade-off.
3. one variable, 2-... more... conditional
4. non-para needs big observations, 
  - but can be used to obtain local problems.
  - many small bumps (non-smoothness) imply big data problems
  - uniform h : two ways of being selected. cross validation... 
  - local linear.. local constant...
  - can not predict at places where there is no data.
  - smooth coefficient (in particular becomes model with interaction terms), different from random coeffcient (the parameter change comes from randomness)
5. sample selection?
6. outliers? matching, discrete/continuous

statistical modelling mood..
constrained regression..

为什么有时会空白？没有预期，调出模型。
